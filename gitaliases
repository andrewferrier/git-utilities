# vim: set filetype=gitconfig
#
# Some generic git aliases which may be of use to many folks. These aliases
# can be included as part of your .gitconfig thusly:
#
# [include]
#   path = ~/somewhere/gitaliases
#
# The aliases are:
#
# * pullall - Pulls a base repository (using a rebase for a clean history) and
#   recursively updates all referenced submodules also.
#
# (Based on this StackOverflow answer:
# http://stackoverflow.com/a/19095988/27641)
#
# * remove-gitignored - Based on a clean working copy, removes all files and
#   adds them back again, which has the effect of "de-tracking" any files which
#   "should" be ignored by .gitignore rules, but currently aren't.

[alias]
	pullall = !git pull --rebase && git submodule update --init --recursive
	remove-gitignored = !git rm -r --cached . && git add .
